# musical-genre-classifier

In 11th grade, I created a neural network with PyTorch to classify the genre of a song based on characteristics pulled from Spotify data, and a list of 26 different musical genres. This project was part of a year-long independent-study course in Machine Learning. My project mentors were Dr. Zach Gaslowitz and Dr. Eric Severson (both are teachers at Proof School).
